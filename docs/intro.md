# Password Cracking Overview

Passwords are still one of the most widely used ways to secure systems and online accounts. Even with newer authentication methods available, weak and reused passwords continue to be a major security issue.

This repository is intended for learning and awareness. It explains how password cracking works at a high level, why weak passwords are easy to break, and what developers and users can do to reduce these risks.

Understanding common attack techniques doesn’t mean using them maliciously. It helps developers and security engineers think like an attacker, identify weak points, and design more secure authentication systems.

This project focuses on:
- Explaining common password attack concepts
- Showing why weak passwords fail in real scenarios
- Demonstrating how password strength can be evaluated
- Highlighting practical best practices for defense

No real-world cracking tools or illegal methods are included in this repository.
