# Common Types of Password Attacks

Attackers use several techniques to compromise passwords. The approach usually depends on the target system, the attacker’s resources, and how strong the security controls are.

## 1. Brute Force Attacks
Brute force attacks try every possible character combination until the correct password is found. While this approach is straightforward, it becomes impractical when passwords are long and use a mix of characters.

## 2. Dictionary Attacks
Instead of testing all combinations, dictionary attacks rely on lists of commonly used passwords and words. This method works surprisingly well because many users still choose simple or predictable passwords.

## 3. Credential Stuffing
Credential stuffing takes advantage of data breaches. Attackers reuse leaked username and password pairs from one service to attempt logins on other platforms, counting on password reuse.

## 4. Phishing Attacks
Phishing targets users rather than systems. Attackers create fake websites, emails, or forms that look legitimate and trick users into entering their credentials.

## 5. Keylogging
Keyloggers are malicious programs or hardware devices that record keystrokes. Once installed on a system, they can silently capture passwords as users type them.

Knowing how these attacks work makes it easier to recognize risks and apply effective security measures.
